# fair_wages
As David Graeber pointed out in his book "Bullshit Jobs: A Theory", people aren't compensated fairly.
Fair compensation can only occur by looking at the merit/benefit the job has to society, 
and by supplying a correct wage in relation to that (and not by just providing a wage as dictated by the market or by 
providing universal income -as David suggested- or whatever).

In this sense, jobs like football players, tennis players, baseball players, rally and formula 1 drivers, sports brokers, 
real estate agents (which take a percentage of the house's entire value), telemarketers, PR specialists, ... are vastly overpaid.
Other jobs, like nurses, farmers, garbage men, ... are vastly underpaid.

In this repo, you can find the Fair Wage Scale, which dictates a general wage scale (from A to J, A having the highest pay and J the lowest).
For even further precision (wage), each letter also gets a letter (from 1 to 6). 
For instance, within wage range B, B1 would get the highest payment, while B6 would get the lowest wage, but B6 would still get more wage then C1.

The Fair Wage Scale could be used by governments to alter their legal minimum and maximum wages per profession.
